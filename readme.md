### NAME

git_delete_stale_branches – Safely delete your version controlled
branches.

### SYNOPSIS

**git_delete_stale_branches** **--delete** **--git-directory**
git_directory **--config-directory** config_directory

### DESCRIPTION

**git_delete_stale_branches** safely deletes your version controlled
branches. It allows one to version control branches that are not
necessary anymore and delete these checked out branches safely in
another machine. Imagine that you are developing a branch on a machine A
and on a machine B. What happens when you merge that branch or simply
want to delete it? Will you remember which branches are ok to delete
when you use machine B? Or what happens if you try to sync deleted
branches from git when checked out on a branch that needs deletion? This
is where **git_delete_stale_branches** steps in.

#### Relevant files

-   `official` file: a single line file containing the name of the main
    branch. This branch shall never be deleted.

    Example:

        main

-   `deleted` file: a headerless CSV with 2 fields:
    `unix_epoch,branch_name` where `unix_epoch` is the unix epoch of the
    time when the branch is marked for deletion and `branch_name` is the
    branch name.

    Example:

        1677801916,t_204_a_yaml_in_vim_local
        1675099986,t_149_replace_old_scala_metals
        1675099986,t_192_a_local
        1651164877,dev_grammar_vim_grammarous
        1648935017,dev_find_out_why_makeprg_is_stalling_improved_01

#### Recommended usage

One can create the necessary files like so:

    [[ -d ./.git ]] \
        && mkdir -p other/git/branches/ \
        && touch other/git/branches/{deleted,official}

### GENERAL OPTIONS

**-c**, **--config-directory**  
Specify the config directory. This directory must hold the `official`
and `deletes` files.

**-g**, **--git-directory**  
Specify the git root directory that will have its branches deleted.

**-d**, **--delete**  
This flag is spurious but ensures that the user is aware that deletions
will occur.

## TODO

### This project

*   (empty).

### Related to this project

*   Use `recfiles` to define dependencies. Its metadata capabilities are outstanding.

*   [DRY principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself): install jira templates from rec files, define parameters from recfiles, etc. e.g. `if [[ $# != 3 ]]; then` the `3` is hardcoded there.

    *   duplication of knowlegde; if I parse exactly 3 arguments, how can I fix that and reference that number on the docs without templating the bash file?
